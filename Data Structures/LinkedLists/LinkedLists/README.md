# kth from the end of a Linked List
Write a method for the Linked List class which takes a number, k, as a parameter. 
Return the node that is k from the end of the linked list.

## Challenge
The challenge is to iterate through the linked list twice. The first while loop is to know how long the list is. Subtracting how long the loop is by what value k is. Then we'll find k.
