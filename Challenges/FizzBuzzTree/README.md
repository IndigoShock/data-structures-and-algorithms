# FizzBuzzTree
"Conduct “FizzBuzz” on a tree while traversing through it. Change the values of each of the nodes dependent on the current node’s value"

## Challenge
The challenge is to instantiate a binary tree. And traverse through it breadth-first and change the node values based on their value. Example: Changing 3 to fizz. Changing 5 to buzz. And changing values divisible by 3 and 5 to fizzbuzz.
