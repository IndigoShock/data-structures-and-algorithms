# Reverse an Array
Given an array, reverse the values without any in-built methods e.g. Do not use Array.Reverse

## Challenges
The challenge is to use another method rather than the in-built method, Array.Reverse. So what we did is use a for loop starting from the last value. And moving it to the front. The problem we ran mostly into was thinking we had to use a nested for loop.
