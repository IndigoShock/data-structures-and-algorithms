# Binary Search
Given an array, start from the middle of an array and checking if the value is higher or lower than what the desired value is. And working in either direction.

# Challenges
The challenge is to start from the middle and work either to the left or to the right. The most challenging part is perhaps syntax. And thinking a while loop would be best set for this problem when really, we needed a for loop to iterate through the array once.
