# FIFO Animal Shelter
"The shelter operates using a first-in, first-out approach.
Implement enqueue and dequeue methods.

- enqueue(animal): adds animal to the shelter. animal can be either a dog or a cat object.

- dequeue(pref): returns either a dog or a cat. If pref, a string, is ‘cat’ return the longest-waiting cat. If pref is ‘dog’, return the longest-waiting dog. For anything else, return either a cat or a dog.

## Challenges
The challenge is to use both the enqueue and dequeue methods. The difficulty with this is the organization of the animals. And to check whether it is a dog or cat or other animal.
